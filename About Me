<p>I am currently a Web Development student, working towards my W3Schools JavaScript Certificate. I have always been passionate about creating and designing things, 
so I instantly became interested in tech and programming. My strong points include communication, determination, persistance, helping others, and being comfortable enough 
to work indepedently or with teamates that are serious about their work enough to get things done. I am currently looking to further my knowlege about tech by taking on 
apprenticeships, internships, or bootcamps.</p>
